# Sii-Interview-task-03

Write a program that, for a given int n (1â‰¤ n 100), will return an array containing n non-repeating integers, the sum of which will be 0. The program can return any such array.
For example, for a given int n = 4, the program could return [1,0,-3,2], and for an int n = 3 one possible response is [-1], but there are many more
correct answers.
